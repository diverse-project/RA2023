  title = {Breathing Ontological Knowledge Into Feature Model Management},
  author = {B\'ecan, Guillaume and Acher, Mathieu and Baudry, Benoit and Ben Nasr, Sana},
  abstract = {Feature Models (FMs) are a popular formalism for modeling and reasoning about the configurations of a software product line. As the manual construction or management of an FM is time-consuming and error-prone for large software projects, recent works have focused on automated operations for reverse engineering or refactoring FMs from a set of configurations/dependencies. Without prior knowledge, meaningless ontological relations (as defined by the feature hierarchy and groups) are likely to be synthesized and cause severe difficulties when reading, maintaining or exploiting the resulting FM. In this paper we define a generic, ontological-aware synthesis procedure that guides users when identifying the likely siblings or parent candidates for a given feature. We develop and evaluate a series of heuristics for clustering/weighting the logical, syntactic and semantic relationships between features. Empirical experiments on hundreds of FMs, coming from the SPLOT repository and Wikipedia, show that an hybrid approach mixing logical and ontological techniques outperforms state-of-the-art solutions and offers the best support for reducing the number of features a user has to consider during the interactive selection of a hierarchy.},

	a specific purpose. In complex systems, many aspects are to be handled,
	from architectural aspects to dynamic behavior, functionalities,
	user-interface, and extra-functional concerns (such as security,
	reliability, timeliness, etc.) For software systems, the design process
	can then be characterized as the weaving of all these aspects into
	a detailed design model. Model Driven Design aims at automating this
	weaving process, that is automatically deriving software systems
	from theirs models. This paper explores the relationship between
	modeling and aspect weaving. It points out some of the challenges
	related to such automatic model weaving, illustrating them with the
	example of a weaving process for behavioral models represented as
	scenarios},

The architect knowledge is essential to identify variation points and explicit constraints between features, for instance in feature models (FMs), but the manual creation of FMs is both time-consuming and error-prone. On a large scale, it is very difficult for an architect to guarantee that the resulting FM ensures a safe composition of the architectural elements when some features are selected. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, tool supported process for reverse engineering architectural FMs. We develop automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions of an architecture. Then, alignment and reasoning techniques are applied to integrate the architect knowledge and reinforce the extracted FM. We illustrate the reverse engineering process when applied to a representative software system, FraSCAti, and we report on our experience in this context. }},

	Abstract = {Feature modeling is a widely used technique in Software Product Line development. Feature models allow stakeholders to describe domain concepts in terms of commonalities and differences within a family of software systems. Developing a complex monolithic feature model can require significant effort and restrict the reusability of a set of features already modeled. We advocate using modeling techniques that support separating and composing concerns to better manage the complexity of developing large feature models. In this paper, we propose a set of composition operators dedicated to feature models. These composition operators enable the development of large feature models by composing smaller feature models which address well-defined concerns. The operators are notably distinguished by their documented capabilities to preserve some significant properties.},

The challenge is to specify the adaptation rules that can link the dynamic variability of the context with the possible variants of the system. 
Our work investigates the systematic use of feature models for modeling the context and the software variants, together with their inter relations, as a way to configure the adaptive system with respect to a particular context. 
A case study in the domain of video surveillance systems is used to illustrate
the approach.},

  abstract = {Product line processes still lack support for testing end-product
	functions by taking advantage of the specific features of a product
	line (commonality and variabilities). Indeed, classical testing approaches
	cannot be directly applied on each product since, due to the potentially
	huge number of products, the testing task would be far too long and
	expensive. There is thus a need for testing methods, adapted to the
	product line context, that allow reducing the testing cost. The approach
	we present is based on the automation of the generation of application
	system tests, for any chosen product, from the system requirements
	of a product line. These PL requirements are modeled using enhanced
	{UML} use cases which are the basis for the test generation. Product-specific
	test objectives, test scenarios, and test cases are successively
	tional variation points at requirement level to automatically generate
	the behaviors specific to any chosen product. With such a strategy,
	the designer may apply any method to produce the domain models of
	the product line and then instantiate a given product: the test cases
	check that the expected functionalities have been correctly implemented.
	The approach is adaptive and provides automated test generation for
	a new product as well as guided test generation support to validate
	the evolution of a given product.},

  abstract = {Where object-oriented languages deal with objects as described by
	classes, model-driven development uses models, as graphs of interconnected
	objects, described by metamodels. A number of new languages have
	been and continue to be developed for this modelbased paradigm, both
	for model transformation and for general programming using models.
	Many of these use single-object approaches to typing, derived from
	solutions found in object-oriented systems, while others use metamodels
	asmodel types, but without a clear notion of polymorphism. Both of
	these approaches lead to brittle and overly restrictive reuse characteristics.
	In this paper we propose a simple extension to object-oriented typing
	to better cater for a model-oriented context, including a simple
	strategy for typing models as a collection of interconnected objects.
	We suggest extensions to existing type system formalisms to support
	these concepts and theirmanipulation. Using a simple examplewe show
	how this extended approach permits more flexible reuse, while preserving
	type safety.},
