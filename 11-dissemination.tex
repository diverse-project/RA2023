\subsubsection {Teaching}

 The \team{} team bears the bulk of the teaching on Software Engineering at the 
 University of Rennes 1 and at INSA Rennes, for the first year of the Master of Computer Science
 (Project Management, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with UML, Design Patterns, 
 Component Architectures and Frameworks, Validation \& Verification, Human-Computer Interaction) 
 and for the second year of the MSc in software engineering (Model driven Engineering, Aspect-Oriented Software Development, 
 Software Product Lines, Component Based Software Development, Validation \& Verification, \textit{etc.}). 
 
 Each of Jean-Marc J\'{e}z\'{e}quel, No\"el Plouzeau, Olivier Barais, Benoît Combemale, Johann Bourcier, Arnaud Blouin, Stéphanie Challita and Mathieu Acher teaches about 250h in these domains for a grand total of about 2000 hours, including several courses at ENSTB, IMT, ENS Rennes and ENSAI Rennes engineering school.
 
Olivier~Barais is deputy director of the electronics and computer science teaching department of the University of Rennes~1.
Olivier Barais is the head of the Master in Computer Science at the University of Rennes~1.
Johann Bourcier has been the head of the Computer Science department and member of the management board at the ESIR engineering school in Rennes until 08/2021, and Benoît Combemale took the responsability afterward.
Arnaud Blouin is in charge of industrial relationships for the computer science department at INSA Rennes and elected member of this CS department council.
 
 The \team{} team also hosts several MSc and summer trainees every year.
